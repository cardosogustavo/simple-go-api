Simple CRUD api in GO

# Steps taken

First I have downloaded an created a MongoDB database in my WSL instance:

https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#std-label-install-mdb-community-ubuntu

After you setup your MongoDB instance, you get the connection string to use inside the code.

Then, it was a matter of exploring/trial and error/checking documentation. You know the drill.
